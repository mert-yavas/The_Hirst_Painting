# The Hirst Painting

## Overview
Hello everyone! I'm Mert, and today marks Day 18 of my "100 Days of Python" journey. To celebrate, I've created a Python Turtle Art project that generates a visually appealing grid of colorful dots. This project is a fun exploration of the Turtle graphics library, offering a creative and interactive experience.

## Project Description
The Python script uses the Turtle library to draw a grid of dots with random colors. The dots are organized in rows and columns, creating a visually interesting pattern. The project showcases the flexibility of Turtle graphics and allows you to experiment with different colors and grid configurations.

## How to Run
To run this Python Turtle Art project, simply execute the provided script:

```bash
python The_Hirst_Painting.py
```

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

## Code Structure
The code is organized as follows:

- `The_Hirst_Painting.py`: The main Python script containing the Turtle Art project.


## Educational Insights
This project provides hands-on experience in using Turtle graphics and reinforces Python programming concepts, including:

- Library Integration: Incorporating the Turtle graphics library for creative visual output.
- Randomization: Utilizing the `random` module to choose random colors for the dots.
- Looping and Positioning: Employing loops to draw rows of dots and repositioning the Turtle for each line.
- Screen Management: Configuring the Turtle screen for an optimal display.

## Customization
Feel free to customize the project by experimenting with different color combinations, dot sizes, or grid arrangements. It's a fantastic opportunity to unleash your creativity and see the immediate visual impact in the Turtle graphics window.

## Conclusion
I hope you enjoy exploring this Turtle Art project! It's a delightful way to celebrate Day 18 of my Python journey. Have fun experimenting and happy coding!
